### Introduction
#### Overview

### Data Description
Dataset: An open dataset for human SSVEPs in the frequency range of 1-60Hz
* #### Experimental Design/Paradigm
    The dataset consist of a wide frequency range of 1–60Hz (interval 1Hz) of SSVEP responds using flickering stimuli under two different modulation depths.
    Data collected from participant ranging in age from 21 to 35 years, with normal or corrected-to-normal vision.
* #### Data Size
    * 30 subjects
    * 64 channels of EEG signals
    * Data included a total of 120 different stimuli
    * 60 stimulation frequencies
    * With 2 sets of greyscales
* #### Sampling rate
    * Sampled with 1000 Hz
    * Downsampled from to 250Hz
* #### Hardware and Software Used
   *  Data collected with Neuroscan Synamps2 system according to the international 10/20 system
    * With a 50 Hz notch filter and 0.1 Hz to 100 Hz band-pass filter
